💻 Computer Programming Career Site

This is a multi-page HTML and CSS project designed to introduce the field of Computer Programming, outline related career information, and map out potential milestones for a career path.

The project uses a clean, responsive layout structure defined in the external style.css file.

📁 File Structure

The project consists of three interconnected HTML pages and a single shared stylesheet:

index.html: The Home Page introducing the field of computer programming and displaying career images.

jobinfo.html: Provides Career Details including salary estimates, required skills, and cognitive abilities.

milestones.html: Outlines the Steps to Success (educational and practical milestones).

style.css: The shared stylesheet defining the layout, colors, and background.

⚠️ Important Note on External Assets

This project uses external URLs for images in both the HTML files and the CSS file.

CodeHS Image URLs (HTML): The career images in index.html (e.g., https://codehs.com/uploads/...) are likely specific to a learning environment. They may not load when viewed outside that environment due to security restrictions (CORS). You should replace these links with local images.

Background Image (CSS): The body background image in style.css uses a Google static URL, which may be unstable or block access in the future.

Content Discrepancy

Please note the milestones.html page currently lists the ultimate goal as "Get a Bachelor's Degree in Paleontology". This appears to be a mismatch with the overall theme of "Computer Programming." This should be corrected to ensure the career path is consistent.
